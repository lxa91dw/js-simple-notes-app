# hangman2js
JavaScript version of Hangman game with improvements for Web and Mobile usability.

The hangman 2 game is a simple version of the hangman game that allows players to choose either a random 3 word puzzle or a random puzzle related to my experiences on Lake Hopatcong in Jefferson, NJ.

This project uses both Babel to ensure that the javascript code is backward compatible with a large array of browsers and webpack to ensure everything is minimized and using the latest packages available.
